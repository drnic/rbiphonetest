Feature: Development processes of newgem itself (rake tasks)

  As a Newgem maintainer or contributor
  I want rake tasks to maintain and release the gem
  So that I can spend time on the tests and code, and not excessive time on maintenance processes
    
  Scenario: Generate RubyGem
    Given this project is active project folder
    And 'pkg' folder is deleted
    When I invoke task 'rake gem'
    Then folder 'pkg' is created
    And file with name matching 'pkg/*.gem' is created else you should run "rake manifest" to fix this
    And gem spec key 'rdoc_options' contains /--mainREADME.rdoc/
