== 0.4.0 2009-03-17 rbiphonetest critical bug fix: supports 2+ dependent models/classes

<a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/07/04/unit-testing-iphone-apps-with-ruby-rbiphonetest/">rbiphonetest</a> had a very nasty/critical bug where you couldn't develop/test Objective-C classes that were dependent upon each other. Individual projects that used rbiphonetest solved this problem, but only now has the solution be refactored back into the rbiphonetest generator. Yay!

The internals of the rbiphonetest gem are now covered by cucumber scenarios too so it will be much easier to add features with confidence.
